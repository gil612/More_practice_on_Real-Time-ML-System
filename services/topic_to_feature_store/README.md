Some notes on the feature store:

recieve messages from kafka topic - that means we must run trade_producer and trade_to_ohlc with docker run command.

For feature store I will use hopsworks. When it comes to specific tools I will use hopsworks-api. If we use aws, i will use SageMaker Feature Store.

# Here are some open-source feature store:
