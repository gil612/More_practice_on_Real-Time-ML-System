What is the differece between online and offlline feature store?

Online feature store is the one that is used for real-time predictions.
Offline feature store is the one that is used for batch predictions. - it keeps historical features for training pipelines.

- Some Pytohn packages need a gcc compiler to be installed, so I add command to the docker compiler to install it.
